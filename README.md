# 6502-Tiny-BASIC

This is Bob Applegate's (bob@corshamtech.com) spin of a Tiny BASIC interpreter for the 6502.  It uses an IL approach, like proposed by Dr Dobb's Journal in the first few issues.  This is not fancy, it's not bug free, and it's not amazing by any means, but it was fun to write and decent enough to do fun stuff and run demos.
